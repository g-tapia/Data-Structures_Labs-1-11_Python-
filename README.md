# Data-Structures-Labs-1-11-Python-

This repository contains a series of labs aimed at introducing and solidifying knowledge in various data structures and algorithms. Each lab focuses on a specific concept, introducing its theory, and then applying it in practice. (Note: I was not able to extract the pdf descriptions from mimir so I had to take screenshots. They will be at the bottom of this readme).

## Lab 1: Basic Python

**Purpose:** This lab serves as an introduction to Python programming. It covers basic Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and other fundamental concepts.

**Implementation:** We implemented various simple functions and data manipulation tasks using Python's built-in data types and control structures. This laid the foundation for the future labs and the rest of the Python programming journey.

## Lab 2: Iocane

**Purpose:** The second lab introduces strategic game theory, encapsulated in a "Princess Bride"-inspired game.

**Implementation:** We implemented different strategies for predicting an opponent's moves based on their previous actions, using conditional logic and basic Python data structures.

## Lab 3: Ngrams

**Purpose:** The Ngrams lab introduces text processing concepts and basics of natural language processing.

**Implementation:** We implemented N-grams, a basic model for predicting the next item in a sequence, to generate new text based on an existing corpus of text.

## Lab 4: ArrayList

**Purpose:** This lab introduces the ArrayList data structure, a fundamental and versatile data structure in computer science.

**Implementation:** We implemented an ArrayList from scratch, including methods for adding and removing elements, retrieving elements at a particular index, and resizing the array as necessary for space efficiency.

## Lab 5: LinkedList

**Purpose:** In this lab, we explore the LinkedList data structure, another fundamental data structure with unique characteristics and use-cases.

**Implementation:** We implemented a LinkedList from scratch, building a node-based structure with methods for adding, removing, and retrieving elements, and traversing the list.

## Lab 6: Hashtable

**Purpose:** The Hashtable lab introduces the concept of hashing and the use of hashtables as a highly efficient data structure for storing and retrieving data.

**Implementation:** We implemented a Hashtable, along with appropriate hashing functions. The implementation includes methods for inserting, retrieving, and deleting elements, managing collisions, and resizing the hashtable for efficiency.

## Lab 7: Stacks and Queues

**Purpose:** This lab focuses on Stacks and Queues, both abstract data types that represent a collection of elements with specific rules for addition and removal.

**Implementation:** We implemented both Stacks (LIFO - Last In First Out) and Queues (FIFO - First In First Out), with methods for adding elements, removing elements, and checking if the structure is empty.

## Lab 8: Heaps

**Purpose:** The Heaps lab focuses on the Heap data structure, a specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property.

**Implementation:** We implemented a binary heap with methods for inserting elements, deleting elements, and heapify operations. We further explored the use of heaps in sorting (heapsort).

## Lab 9: Recursion

**Purpose:** This lab introduces the concept of recursion, a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

**Implementation:** We implemented various recursive functions and algorithms, such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and recursive tree traversal.

## Lab 10: BSTree

**Purpose:** This lab introduces Binary Search Trees (BST), a tree-based data structure with properties that make searching for elements extremely efficient.

**Implementation:** We implemented a binary search tree, complete with insertion, deletion, and searching methods. This included traversal methods and an understanding of the concepts of tree balance.

## Lab 11: AVL Tree (Optional)

**Purpose:** The optional AVL Tree lab extends the concept of BSTs to introduce
